**Last Updated: January 2025**

YaSay (the "App") maintains a Zero-Tolerance Policy against Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE), including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).

This policy applies to all user-generated content (UGC), images, profiles, communications, and interactions on our platform. Our application is a decision-making and advice-seeking service, and we are committed to providing a safe, positive, and lawful environment for all users.

**Age Restrictions**: YaSay is not intended for children under 13 years of age (or under 16 in the European Economic Area), as stated in our Privacy Policy. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under these ages.

## 1. Prohibited Conduct and Content

We strictly prohibit any conduct that facilitates, promotes, or involves CSAE. This includes, but is not limited to:

- The creation, sharing, display, storage, or distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).
- Any attempt to groom, solicit, or exploit a minor for sexual purposes.
- Content or discussions that sexualize, depict, or encourage the abuse of children.
- Posting or sharing links to external content that violates this policy.

## 2. Enforcement and Reporting Procedures

We take immediate and decisive action against violations:

- **In-App Reporting**: Users can report suspicious content or behavior directly within the App using our reporting mechanism.
- **Prompt Removal**: Any content confirmed as CSAM or a violation of this CSAE policy will be immediately removed.
- **Account Termination**: The user account responsible for the violation will be permanently terminated and banned from the platform.
- **Mandatory Reporting**: We comply with all legal obligations, including immediately reporting confirmed CSAM and related illegal activities to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) via the CyberTipline, or to relevant law enforcement agencies.
- **Data Retention for Legal Compliance**: In accordance with our Privacy Policy, we may retain certain information related to CSAE violations where required by law, including information needed for legal compliance, resolving disputes, enforcing our terms of service, and reporting to law enforcement agencies.

## 3. Policy Adherence

By using YaSay, all users agree to comply with this policy, our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and all applicable child safety laws. This CSAE policy works in conjunction with our Privacy Policy, which outlines how we handle user data, including data related to child safety violations.
